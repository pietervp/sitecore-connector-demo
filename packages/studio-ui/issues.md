* no project id => no load => currently it tries to load an 'undefined' project on url http://localhost:3001/undefined/projects/undefined
  * should just render an empty studio-ui with a message,
  * 'load project to get started' or smth

* need a way to load a template / project json ad hoc

* imagevariables are always using grafx-media (it seems)

* need a way to expose the sdk object once available (not register it in the window object)
